# Procrastination

### Habits have four parts:

1. The cue
2. The routine
3. The reward
4. The belief

### PLANNERS AND JOURNALS:

* Planning a quitting time is just as important as planning working time
* Take notes on what works and what doesn't work


### WILLPOWER:

* Because willpower is a limited resource, use it wisely. In the same way you can use willpower ONCE at the store to not buy those cookies (instead of using willpower every time you want a cookie at home), you can use willpower once, and that is at your *reaction to a procrastination cue*
* Negative feelings at the beginning (or before) a learning session are very normal. It is totally OK to not look forward to a study/learning session. It's what you do with those feelings (PUSH THROUGH, FOCUS ON PUTTING THE TIME IN) that matters.


### PROCESS VS PRODUCT:

* Focus on the PROCESS, not the PRODUCT. Focusing on the PRODUCT is what triggers pain, which in turn, triggers procrastination.
* PROCESS is relating to the time you're spending working. E.g. "I'm going to spend 25 minutes on this study block"
* PRODUCT is focusing on the end result of something. This can lead to pain, which can lead to procrastination. Thinking about COMPLETING A PRODUCT is frequently what triggers the pain that leads to the procrastination. 

### REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF PROCRASTINATION CUES:

* Don't let the distraction annoy you or get you down -- like meditation, simply let the distraction drift by 
* Use noise-cancelling headphones or other physical interventions that might help!


# MEMORY

## Diving Deeper into Memory


What is a concept you're trying to learn in class, or a concept or series of ideas you've always simply wanted to be able to remember?  Can you think of an image that could help you to encapsulate the concept or ideas in memory so that you can more readily call them to mind? Write your thoughts in the box below.

RECURSION!!
I seem to always forget how necessary it is to have a base-case, so I will try to recall the Original Recursion Dragon who will only multiply one number at a time. I will try to remember how no Dragon wants zero treasure and having recursion without a base case is like coming to the Recursion Dragon with an empty treasure chest? 

* Memories are not fixed -- they are living, breathing parts of you that can change over time
* Revisiting a memory (recalling it) changes the memory, a process called `reconsolodation`
* ASTROCYTES!! Einstein's brain had many more ASTROCYTES than the average human.
* Neurons aren't the only cells that support the brain! The brain also has glial cells. Of the glial cells, the astrocyte is the most abundant!
* Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, they maintain extra cellular ion balance and help with repairs
