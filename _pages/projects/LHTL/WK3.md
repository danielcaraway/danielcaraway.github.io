### Habits have four parts:

1. The cue
2. The routine
3. The reward
4. The belief

### PLANNERS AND JOURNALS:

* Planning a quitting time is just as important as planning working time
* Take notes on what works and what doesn't work


### WILLPOWER:

* Because willpower is a limited resource, use it wisely. In the same way you can use willpower ONCE at the store to not buy those cookies (instead of using willpower every time you want a cookie at home), you can use willpower once, and that is at your *reaction to a procrastination cue*
* Negative feelings at the beginning (or before) a learning session are very normal. It is totally OK to not look forward to a study/learning session. It's what you do with those feelings (PUSH THROUGH, FOCUS ON PUTTING THE TIME IN) that matters.


### PROCESS VS PRODUCT:

* Focus on the PROCESS, not the PRODUCT. Focusing on the PRODUCT is what triggers pain, which in turn, triggers procrastination.
* PROCESS is relating to the time you're spending working. E.g. "I'm going to spend 25 minutes on this study block"
* PRODUCT is focusing on the end result of something. This can lead to pain, which can lead to procrastination. Thinking about COMPLETING A PRODUCT is frequently what triggers the pain that leads to the procrastination. 

### REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF PROCRASTINATION CUES:

* Don't let the distraction annoy you or get you down -- like meditation, simply let the distraction drift by 
* Use noise-cancelling headphones or other physical interventions that might help!
