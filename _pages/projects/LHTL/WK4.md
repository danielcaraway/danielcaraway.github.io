# Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

## Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy

In 1886, there is a drawing of Monkeys holding hands or tails to represent a benzene ring! The hands are single bonds, the tails are double bonds.

It's often helpful to pretend that YOU are the problem you're trying to understand! Can YOU be the electron!?

## Change your Thoughts, Change your Life

\*Take a moment now and think about your own learning style. Do you think that you take responsibility for your education? Do you think you spend enough time practicing and studying? Are there any specific instances or areas that you think you can improve upon? Write your thoughts below.

By taking the simple action of thinking about this and “chunking” your answers, you can have a surprisingly positive effect on how your learning unfolds. \*

I wish I had learned "How to Learn" back before high school because it would have been so helpful to know that sitting down just for little bits of time (focusing on the PROCESS not the PRODUCT) would be so impactful. Essentially leaving little breadcrumbs for my future self, things that my predictive mind can take advantage of.

My NATURAL learning style is very much like what she described in the video -- hop around and around and around the problem, learning from lectures, YouTube, reddit etc. to triangulate the issue and my understanding. Despite the frustrations of having to "rein my brain in," I am grateful for my innate curiosity -- it makes me love learning!
