The 30 Second Review:

What did I just learn?

The importance of chunking!!
-- Chunking needs understanding
-- Chunking is gathering thoughts together
-- Chunking is stressing the importance of recall

WHAT DID I JUST LEARN:

- Reacall is important
- The 30-second review is something I should do after every video
- The "picture walk" through a textbook is good to get your feelers out.
