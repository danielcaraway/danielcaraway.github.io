* Dive into a position where you are WRONG as quickly as possible
* Using the Feynman technique
  * Take paper out and try to teach someone else 
* CREATE VIVID EXAMPLES: -- simple analogies and metaphors. 
* MENTAL TOOLS FOR MOTIVATION: Little mini projects, little mini steps
* PROJECTS for self-education:
  * Benny Lewis: Always have a mission (3 months in a country to learn a language)
  * make CONCRETE projects that excite you
* MIT's opencourseware have exams, so exam + problem set + book

  * Try specific chunks of time 4 hours :)
