IMPETUS: Math is a fundamental part of what I do and I want to feel more confident about my math abilities.

PROBLEM: Where does one start?!

SOLUTION: Ask the internet, of course!

PROBLEM: The internet has SO. MANY. OPINIONS.

SOLUTION: Start at the very very very beginning and...

1. Learn How to Learn (LHTL)
2. Become a better reader (How to Read a Book)

PROBLEM: There are SO many books to read and I don't retain written text like I do audio text and a lot of math books don't come with an audio version

SOLUTION: Become a better reader. The Internet suggests "How To Read A Book"

PROBLEM: This book is big and I'm afraid I won't retain anything

SOLUTION: Investigate Speed Reading, with the book Speed Reading "Learn to Read a 200+ Page Book in 1 Hour"
