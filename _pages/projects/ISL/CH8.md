### 8.1 Tree-based Methods

### 8.2 More details on Trees

- Bushy trees have high variance -- they are overfitting the data and likely not going to predict well

#### PRUNING:

- A good strategy is to build a large tree and PRUNE it back to obtain a SUBTREE
- Cost Complexity Pruning, aka weakest link pruning
  - Similar to LASSO in regression
  - We use Cross Validation to help us choose alpha

### 8.3 Classification Trees

### 8.4 Bagging and Random Forests
