## OUTLINE FROM LECTURES

### 9.1 Optimal Separating Hyperplanes

There is no probability model -- it just looks for a hyperplane that separates the classes in a direct way

QUESTION
If ùõΩ is not a unit vector but instead has length 2, then ‚àëùëùùëó=1ùõΩùëóùëãùëó is

ANSWER
twice the signed Euclidean distance from the separating hyperplane ‚àëùëùùëó=1ùõΩùëóùëãùëó=0

EXPLANATION
We know ùõΩ‚Ä≤=12ùõΩ has length 1, so it is a unit vector in the same direction as ùõΩ . Therefore, ‚àëùëùùëó=1ùõΩùëóùëãùëó=2‚àëùëùùëó=1ùõΩ‚Ä≤ùëóùëãùëó , where ‚àëùëùùëó=1ùõΩ‚Ä≤ùëóùëãùëó is the Euclidean distance.

### 9.2 Support Vector Classifier

If N > P, data is often not separable by a linear boundary.

HOWEVER, in problems like genomics and other problems with a lot of y-data, the sample points are less than the dimensions and...

When the number of sample points is less than the number of dimensions (y) you can always separate with a hyperplane.

QUESTION

If we increase C (the error budget) in an SVM, do you expect the standard error of ùõΩ to increase or decrease?

ANSWER

Decrease

EXPLANATION

Increasing C makes the margin "softer," so that the orientation of the separating hyperplane is influenced by more points.

### 9.3 Feature Expansion and the SVM

* We can quickly and simply give ourselves more features by raising existing features to the power of 2,3,4 etc... X^2, X^3 etc.. `(X1, X2, X1^2, X2^2, X1*X2)`
* When we do this, we add dimensions. The more dimensions we have, the more likely we will find a separator

#### Nonlinearities and Kernels

* We don't like doing polynomial regression with a degree bigger than 3 (even cubic polynomial space is a big space)
