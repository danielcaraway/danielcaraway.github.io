### 10.1 Review Questions: 

QUESTION:

You are analyzing a dataset where each observation is an age, height, length, and width of a particular turtle. You want to know if the data can be well described by fewer than four dimensions (maybe for plotting), so you decide to do Principal Component Analysis. Which of the following is most likely to be the loadings of the first Principal Component?

Explanation

We know that options 1 and 4 cannot be right because the sum of the squared loadings exceeds 1. The second option is most likely correct because we expect all four variables to be positively correlated with each-other.

Note that it is fairly common for the loadings of the first principal component to all have the same sign. In such a case, the principal component is often referred to as a size component.


### THREE BULLETS:

1. sum of squared loadings must not exceed 1
2. We can add even more parameters by adding a second level of PCA (?)
3. There is a way we can graph this that is cool? 


## HIGHER ORDER PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS

1. How is PCA different from least squares regression? Least squares regression is also finding a hyperplane that can get close to the data, but here, "closest" means "closet to y" where in PCA we have no y, so it's the shortest distance of the hyperplane to 
2. If the variables are different units, scaling each to have a standard deviation of 1 is recommended
3. TOTAL VARIANCE = sum of the variance of all the variables 
4. You want to look for the elbow in the scree plot


QUIZ QUESTION

Suppose we a data set where each data point represents a single student's scores on a math test, a physics test, a reading comprehension test, and a vocabulary test.

We find the first two principal components, which capture 90% of the variability in the data, and interpret their loadings. We conclude that the first principal component represents overall academic ability, and the second represents a contrast between quantitative ability and verbal ability.

What loadings would be consistent with that interpretation? Choose all that apply.


(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5)
(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and (-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5)


Explanation

For the first two choices, the two loading vectors are not orthogonal. For the fifth and sixth choices, the first set of loadings only has to do with two specific tests. For the third and fourth pairs of loadings, the first component is proportional to average score, and the second component measures the difference between the first pair of scores and the second pair of scores.


### k-means clustering

K-means clustering defines "good clustering" as minimal variance between points within a cluster
when "within cluster variation is small"

* We get different results if we choose a different starting point
