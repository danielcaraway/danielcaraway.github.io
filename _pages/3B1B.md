# What goal is this supporting?

Ostensibly, the data science goal.
However, I believe I could make a case for this also helping with the "problem solving" side of interview questions for software engineering...

## The Determinant | [Essence of Linear Algebra, Chapter 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3X9LOh2dk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=6&t=25s)

"The Factor by which a linear transformation changes any area"
"The factor by which area is changed, after applying a linear transformation."

1. Have shape.
2. Apply transformation
3. How much did the shape change? The factor by which it changed is called the determinant/
