# SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:

Having a completed "Tableau Desktop Specialist" on my Linkedin Profile

## NOTES:

### 02-16-21

- CSV? Use Text File
- Where is “My Tableau Repository? Inside Documents
- How do I add my own custom shapes? Inside My Tableau Repository, under Shapes. I simply replace the png file with my own.
- What is a role? What’s a type? A type is the datatype. Tableau specifies specific string types, too. Like, global location (e.g. United States is not simply a string)
- USUALLY, tableau will assign numeric data to MEASURES
- USUALLY, numeric data will be in the MEASURES shelf
- USUALLY, qualitative data will be in the DIMENSIONS shelf
- You can CONVERT numeric to “dimensions” and vice versa
