1. Supervised learning is machine learning with labels
2. Accuracy = number correctly predicted. As a measure of fit, is only good when the labeled data is balanced (e.g. half dogs, half cats -- NOT people with disease vs people no disease)
4. Recall
   1. Ability to find ALL relevant cases
   2. `number of true positives / (number of true positives + number of false negatives)`
5. Precision
   1. Ability to identify ONLY relevant data points
   2. `number of true positives / (number of true positives + number of false positives)`
6. F1 is a measure of the harmonic mean of precision and recall, taking both metrics into account
7. NOTE: There is no "best measure of fit" -- it 100% depends on what you're trying to test for. (e.g. a false positive is much better than a false negative in cancer tests)
