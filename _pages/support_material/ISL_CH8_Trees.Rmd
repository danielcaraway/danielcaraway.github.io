# DECISION TREES

## DATA: Carseats
## PACKAGE: `tree`

```{r}
rm(Sales)
rm(High)
rm(Carseats)
require(ISLR)
require(tree)
attach(Carseats)
hist(Sales)
# High=ifelse(Sales<=8,"No","Yes")
# Carseats=data.frame(Carseats,High)
# tree.carseats=tree(High~.-Sales,Carseats)
# summary(tree.carseats)
# plot(tree.carseats)

High=ifelse(Sales<=8,"No", "Yes")
Carseats=data.frame(Carseats,High)
Carseats = na.omit(Carseats)
tree.carseats =tree(High~.-Sales , Carseats )
test = na.omit(tree.carseats)
summary(test)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
tree.carseats=tree(High~.-Sales,data=Carseats)
summary(tree.carseats)
plot(tree.carseats)
```



-----
```{r}
high_binary = ifelse(Sales <= 8, "No", "Yes")
c_df = data.frame(Carseats, high_binary)
high
```   
### Now, we want to fit a tree to the data!

NOTE: We must remove `Sales` because the response is derived from `Sales`

```{r}
tree.carseats = tree(high_binary ~ . - Sales, data = c_df)
summary(tree.carseats)
```
