# Intro to Data Science

MSDS - Q1: IST687

## COURSE DESCRIPTION:

The course introduces students to applied examples of data collection, processing, transformation,
management, and analysis to provide students with hands-on introduction to data science
experience. Students will explore key concepts related to data science, including applied
statistics, information visualization, text mining and machine learning. “R”, the open source
statistical analysis and visualization system, will be used throughout the course. R is reckoned by
many to be the most popular choice among data analysts worldwide; having knowledge and skill
with using it is considered a valuable and marketable job skill for most data scientists.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

At the end of the course, students are expected to understand:

* Essential concepts and characteristics of data
* Scripting/code development for data management using R and R-Studio
* Principles and practices in data screening, cleaning, and linking
* Communication of results to decision makers

At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

* Identify a problem and the data needed for addressing the problem
* Perform basic computational scripting using R and other optional tools
* Transform data through processing, linking, aggregation, summarization, and searching
* Organize and manage data at various stages of a project lifecycle
* Determine appropriate techniques for analyzing data
