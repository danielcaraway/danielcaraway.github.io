### Documenting different approaches to LAB 9

STARTING [HERE](https://danielcaraway.github.io/assets/ist718lab9/IST718_LAB9_i2.html)

First, clearly I've been asking [the wrong questions](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/10/08/keras-vs-tensorflow-which-one-is-better-and-which-one-should-i-learn/)

Also, clearly I jumped in too soon because I needed to go [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/10/keras-tutorial-how-to-get-started-with-keras-deep-learning-and-python/) to understand what's happening

OK so I thought "going down another tutorial hole won't be helpful"

So I went back to "simply" "adding new classification algorithms" to the setup I already have. 
This did not go well.

Showed many holes in my understanding. 

## Afternoon update

I backed WAY up and did

I'm pretty proud of this adventure as I feel like I understand MUCH MORE of what's happening now.
