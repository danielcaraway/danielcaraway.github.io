**ACTOR:**
Little tyke,
--
**ACTOR:**
The Potters, thats right, thats what I heard yes, their son, Harry
--
**ACTOR:**
Sorry,
--
**ACTOR:**
Dont be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!
--
**ACTOR:**
Shoo!
--
**ACTOR:**
Wont!
--
**ACTOR:**
And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.
--
**ACTOR:**
Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?
--
**ACTOR:**
Well, Ted,
--
**ACTOR:**
I dont know about that, but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, theyve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- its not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.
--
**ACTOR:**
Er -- Petunia, dear -- you havent heard from your sister lately, have you?
--
**ACTOR:**
No,
--
**ACTOR:**
Why?
--
**ACTOR:**
Funny stuff on the news,
--
**ACTOR:**
Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...
--
**ACTOR:**
So?
--
**ACTOR:**
Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.
--
**ACTOR:**
Potter.
--
**ACTOR:**
Their son -- hed be about Dudleys age now, wouldnt he?
--
**ACTOR:**
I suppose so,
--
**ACTOR:**
Whats his name again? Howard, isnt it?
--
**ACTOR:**
Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.
--
**ACTOR:**
Oh, yes,
--
**ACTOR:**
Yes, I quite agree.
--
**ACTOR:**
I should have known.
--
**ACTOR:**
Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.
--
**ACTOR:**
How did you know it was me?
--
**ACTOR:**
My dear Professor, I ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.
--
**ACTOR:**
Youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day,
--
**ACTOR:**
All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.
--
**ACTOR:**
Oh yes, everyones celebrating, all right,
--
**ACTOR:**
Youd think theyd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed somethings going on. It was on their news.
--
**ACTOR:**
I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, theyre not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- Ill bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.
--
**ACTOR:**
You cant blame them,
--
**ACTOR:**
Weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.
--
**ACTOR:**
I know that,
--
**ACTOR:**
But thats no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.
--
**ACTOR:**
A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he  really has gone, Dumbledore?
--
**ACTOR:**
It certainly seems so,
--
**ACTOR:**
We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?
--
**ACTOR:**
A what?
--
**ACTOR:**
A lemon drop. Theyre a kind of Muggle sweet Im rather fond of
--
**ACTOR:**
No, thank you,
--
**ACTOR:**
As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -
--
**ACTOR:**
My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this You- Know-Who nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.
--
**ACTOR:**
It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who. I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemorts name. 
--
**ACTOR:**
But youre different. Everyone knows youre the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.
--
**ACTOR:**
You flatter me,
--
**ACTOR:**
Voldemort had powers I will never have.
--
**ACTOR:**
Only because youre too -- well -- noble to use them.
--
**ACTOR:**
Its lucky its dark. I havent blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.
--
**ACTOR:**
The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyones saying? About why hes disappeared? About what finally stopped him?
--
**ACTOR:**
everyone
--
**ACTOR:**
What theyre saying,
--
**ACTOR:**
is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godrics Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that theyre -- dead. 
--
**ACTOR:**
Lily and James... I cant believe it... I didnt want to believe it... Oh, Albus...
--
**ACTOR:**
I know... I know...
--
**ACTOR:**
Thats not all. Theyre saying he tried to kill the Potters son, Harry. But -- he couldnt. He couldnt kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill Harry Potter, Voldemorts power somehow broke -- and thats why hes gone.
--
**ACTOR:**
Its -- its true?
--
**ACTOR:**
After all hes done... all the people hes killed... he couldnt kill a little boy? Its just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?
--
**ACTOR:**
We can only guess,
--
**ACTOR:**
We may never know.
--
**ACTOR:**
Hagrids late. I suppose it was he who told you Id be here, by the way?
--
**ACTOR:**
Yes,
--
**ACTOR:**
And I dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here, of all places?
--
**ACTOR:**
Ive come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. Theyre the only family he has left now.
--
**ACTOR:**
You dont mean -- you cant mean the people who live here?
--
**ACTOR:**
Dumbledore -- you cant. Ive been watching them all day. You couldnt find two people who are less like us. And theyve got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!
--
**ACTOR:**
Its the best place for him,
--
**ACTOR:**
His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older. Ive written them a letter.
--
**ACTOR:**
A letter?
--
**ACTOR:**
Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! Hell be famous -- a legend -- I wouldnt be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!
--
**ACTOR:**
Exactly,
--
**ACTOR:**
It would be enough to turn any boys head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he wont even remember! CarA you see how much better off hell be, growing up away from all that until hes ready to take it?
--
**ACTOR:**
Yes -- yes, youre right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?
--
**ACTOR:**
Hagrids bringing him.
--
**ACTOR:**
You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
--
**ACTOR:**
I would trust Hagrid with my life,
--
**ACTOR:**
Im not saying his heart isnt in the right place,
--
**ACTOR:**
but you cant pretend hes not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?
--
**ACTOR:**
Hagrid,
--
**ACTOR:**
At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?
--
**ACTOR:**
Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,
--
**ACTOR:**
Young Sirius Black lent it to me. Ive got him, sir.
--
**ACTOR:**
No problems, were there?
--
**ACTOR:**
No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin around. He fell asleep as we was flyin over Bristol.
--
**ACTOR:**
Is that where -?
--
**ACTOR:**
Yes,
--
**ACTOR:**
Hell have that scar forever.
--
**ACTOR:**
Couldnt you do something about it, Dumbledore?
--
**ACTOR:**
Even if I could, I wouldnt. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- wed better get this over with.
--
**ACTOR:**
Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?
--
**ACTOR:**
Shhh!
--
**ACTOR:**
youll wake the Muggles!
--
**ACTOR:**
S-s-sorry,
--
**ACTOR:**
But I c-c-cant stand it -- Lily an James dead -- an poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -
--
**ACTOR:**
Yes, yes, its all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or well be found,
--
**ACTOR:**
Well,
--
**ACTOR:**
thats that. Weve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.
--
**ACTOR:**
Yeah,
--
**ACTOR:**
Ill be takin Sirius his bike back. Gnight, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
--
**ACTOR:**
I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,
--
**ACTOR:**
Good luck, Harry,
--
**ACTOR:**
To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!
