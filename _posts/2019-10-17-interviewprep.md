## Interview Advice

I need specific tips on doing well for my interview as a data analyst at Apple..anyone have advice?

Yes, make sure you know Big Data algorithms in case it comes up. Know Python and Java. Knowing Scala is a major plus. You'll probably be writing code similar to MapReduce on Hadoop so be familiar with how to implement that. Also, smile, speak up and always demonstrate your thought process during the interview.

## Can you quickly highlight some areas I should cover for my interview as a data scientist intern at Facebook?

Highlight any past analytics work, projects that required carrying a business question to final analysis deliverables and next steps, and relevant skills such as coding languages.
