5. HW3 -- Gates
6. HW3 -- Kendra
7. Ran HW3 through HW1 analysis -- took forever
8. While waiting, converted audio files to faster audio files

```console
#!/bin/bash
for filename in ./lane-audio/*.m4a; do
    ./ffmpeg -i $filename -filter:a "atempo=1.7" -c:a aac -q:a 100 ${filename}_fast_v2.m4a
done
```
