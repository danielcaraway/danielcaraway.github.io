PROBLEMS:
1. I want to make a screenshot analyzer.
2. I made a "proof of concept" by downloading my photos labeled "document" by amazon prime photos from October
3. I then ran my script and got text. Very cool, Kanye.
4. BUT NOW, THE PROBLEMS!!

1. Ideally, since the photos are already living somewhere on Amazon's servers, I would just use an API to get access to them. But there is almost no documentation on this, strangely
2. PLAN B: Download all photos from amazon prime and upload them to an Amazon ec2 instance. CON: Extra step
3. PLAN C: Build my own server where I can store all my photos and then set chron jobs to back up at certain times during the day

Annnnd got distracted thinking about building my own server:

[YouTube -- dedicated home server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=79&v=RDwoDj2cW6c&feature=emb_logo)


FILES OPENED AND THEN CLOSED:
Inmates_import
October_screenshots
NLPIA_ch3_cats
