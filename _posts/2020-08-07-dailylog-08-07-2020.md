# GOAL:

I want to visualize zip code data on a map.

## PROBLEM:

I need a map?

## SOLUTION:

Plotly! Just like [THIS!!](https://plotly.com/python/bubble-maps/)

## PROBLEM:

We don't have plotly and are afraid to install it becuase it broke everything last time

## SOLUTION:

[JUST HECKIN' DO IT](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/) BECAUSE WE CAN ALWAYS WIPE AND RESTART AGAIN!!

## PROBLEM:

Plotly + zip codes don't play nice unless you have FIPS data (which we can get but that is another animal)

## SOLUTION:

Look at the [example data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2014_us_cities.csv) and see what they are passing into example plot!!
Very cool!! Lookst like Lat & Long!

## PROBLEM:

Where do we get this "geo data"?

## SOLUTION:

GoogleMaps!! Simply add the zip code to the end of the query string and WIN!!

## PROBLEM:

This code

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json
with urlopen("http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=91011") as response:
    geoj = json.load(response)
```

Gives us this error

```json
{
  "error_message": "You must use an API key to authenticate each request to Google Maps Platform APIs. For additional information, please refer to http://g.co/dev/maps-no-account",
  "results": [],
  "status": "REQUEST_DENIED"
}
```

## SOLUTION:

(In my head) Oh since needing an API key is probably just an issue of backend vs frontend, I WILL CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM AND JUST USE JAVASCRIPT TO CREATE A CSV!!

## PROBLEM:

THIS

```javascript
var response = await fetch(
  "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=91011"
);
var body = await response.json();
```

STILL GIVES US THIS ERROR

```javascript
{error_message: "You must use an API key to authenticate each requeâ€¦, please refer to http://g.co/dev/maps-no-account", results: Array(0), status: "REQUEST_DENIED"}
```

## SOLUTION:

[Get an API key!!](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (Yes, we have to put billing info but there is no way we will exceed 200 requests per second so the likilhood we will get charged is slim... but I should still add a restriction)

## PROBLEM:

Even WITH the API key

```javascript
var response = await fetch(
  "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=91011&key=MY_COOL_KEY"
);
var body = await response.json();
```

We get THIS error

```javascript
{error_message: "This API project is not authorized to use this API.", results: Array(0), status: "REQUEST_DENIED"}
```

## SOLUTION:

Go back to Google and add `Geocoding API` to your project

... and finally, the above request works :)
