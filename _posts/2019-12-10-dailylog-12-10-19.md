### Multivariate Normal Distribution

In modern time, the multivariate normal distribution is incredibly important in machine learning, whose purpose is (very roughly speaking) to categorize input data xx into labels yy, based on some training pairs x,yx,y. One major approach involves analyzing the distribution p(x|y)p(xâˆ£y), and approximating it with a multivariate normal distribution, the validity of which can be checked using various normality tests;
