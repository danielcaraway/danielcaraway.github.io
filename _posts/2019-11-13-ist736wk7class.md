Dimensionality Reduction methods

Cannot reduce dimensions in protein folding
Order matters so much 
Facial Recognition --
Needs Advanced Linear Algebra 

## PCA and ICA
aren't going to give things that the model things is important 
These generate the ones with the most information 
Common to use PCA to reduce to 3D so we can visualize

## ICA
Highest independence from each other
Used a lot for signal separation

Calculate variance
Calculate co-variance -- correlation (if high correlation, don't need both)


TODO:
Code your OWN svm in python
legrangian multipliers

LABEL IS NEVER PART OF THE DATASET

### SVMS

Can my dataset be broken into two groups? 
Can it be linearly separated? 
A single SVM can only classify into one of two groups
If you have MULTIPLE variables, you use MULTIPLE svms
First SVM is mammal and not mammal. 
Second SVM is fish or birds
^^ Called an ENSEMBLE of SVMs
it will find THE BEST linear separater
It has to define what is best
Soft Margin SVM

A kernel is a function applied to... all the things

SVM ONLY works on NUMERIC data

Cannot label Titanic data as 0 and 1 

Look up min max 

When you build a model, you know the testing and training and you have the labels for both 
NORMALIZE THE DATA BEFORE SPLITTING INTO TEST AND TRAIN
