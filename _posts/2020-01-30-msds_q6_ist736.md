# Text Mining

MSDS - Q6: IST736

## Description: 

Introduces concepts and methods for knowledge discovery from large amounts of text data and the application of text mining techniques for business intelligence, digital humanities, and social behavior analysis.

### Additional Course Description: 

The main goal of this course is to increase student awareness of the power of large amounts of text data and computational methods to find patterns in large text corpora. This course is designed as a general introductory- level course for all students who are interested in text mining. Programming skill is preferred but not required in this class. This course will introduce the concepts and methods of text mining technologies rooted from machine learning, natural language processing, and statistics. This course will also showcase the applications of text mining technologies in (1) information organization and access, (2) business intelligence,(3) social behavior analysis,and (4) digital humanities.

## Learning Objectives:

### After taking this course, the students will be able to:
* describe basic concepts and methods in text mining, for example document representation, information extraction, text classification and clustering, and topic modeling;
* use benchmark corpora, commercial and open-source text analysis and visualization tools to explore interesting patterns;
* understand conceptually the mechanism of advanced text mining algorithms for information extraction, text classification and clustering, opinion mining, and their applications in real-world problems; and
* choose appropriate technologies for specific text analysis tasks and evaluate the benefit and challenges of the chosen technical solution.
