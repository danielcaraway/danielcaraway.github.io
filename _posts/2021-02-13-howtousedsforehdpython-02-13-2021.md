OK so, let's go step by step:

1. First, we find the external hard drive (duh)
2. Then, we find the folder we want to "Flatten and Rename" (also, duh)
3. Then, we go about the process of "Flattening and Renaming" the files using our PORTFOLIO_SCRAPING_EHD_RENAME_AND_MOVE file (or the code posted on Daniel daily log 02-13-21)
4. Then, once we have the "Flat File" (usually appended with an \_\_ALL), we can go through the process of SORTING the flat file. This uses a different python file. This uses the (currently titled) PORTFOLIO_SCRAPING_EHD_CLEAN file and the associated csv files with extension and parent folder locations

Remind me, why are we doing all of this again?

Because there is A LOT of junk on these external hard drives. And because the current way they are storing the files (ummmm there is no system or convention because I change those faster than I change uniform iterations) does NOT lend itself to easy retrieval. If I had been better at naming, maybe we'd have a different story. I DO have that google colab where I can find all files with X extension or with Y in the name... but this doesn't help me answer the question "What projects did I work on during the last week of DBC, August 2012?"
