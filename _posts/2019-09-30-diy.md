# Troubleshooting the git issues I always seem to have:
1. [Changing author](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/changing-author-info)
2. [Setting commit email address:](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address)

Note: Does anyone know how to avoid pushing from git with the .local email address? I have to do this every time and I am sure it's a simple step that I'm just... totally missing. HALP PLZ.

## Setting Commit Email Address

### Globally

```console
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```

### Per Project

```console
$ cd YOUR-PROJECT-DIRECTORY
$ git config user.email "email@example.com"
```

## Changing Author
(script to run)

```console
#!/bin/sh

git filter-branch --env-filter '

OLD_EMAIL="oldemail@Your-MacBook-Pro.local"
CORRECT_NAME="yourname"
CORRECT_EMAIL="newemail@gmail.com"

if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
then
    export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi
if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
then
    export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi
' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags
```
