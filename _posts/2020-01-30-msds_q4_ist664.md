# Natural Language Processing

MSDS - Q4: IST664


# Description:

Linguistic and computational aspects of natural language processing technologies. Lectures, readings, and projects in the computational techniques required to perform all levels of linguistic processing of text.

## Course Description:

This course is designed to develop an understanding of how natural language processing (NLP) can process written text and produce a linguistic analysis that can be used in other applications. This goal will be achieved by:

* Readings, lectures, and class discussions of the multiple levels of linguistic analysis required for a computer to accept natural language input, interpret it, and carry out a particular application.
* Lab exercises and assignments in using some of the computational techniques required to perform these levels of natural language processing of text.
* Studies of real足world applications that incorporate substantive NLP modules.

The course primarily covers the techniques of NLP in the levels of linguistic analysis, going through tokenization, word足level semantics, part足of足speech tagging, syntax, semantics, and on up to the discourse level. It also includes the use of the NLP techniques, such as information retrieval, question answering, sentiment analysis, summarization and dialogue systems, in applications.
