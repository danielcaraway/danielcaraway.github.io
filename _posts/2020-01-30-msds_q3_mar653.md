## Class Project

Start with a directed research question and then ensure that you have data available to be able to answer that research question. I have provided some datasets that you may use for the project. Alternatively, you may wish to use data that you collect, have access to or source on your own from websites such as Kaggle. Kaggle datasets can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets. Some academic journals such Journal of Marketing Research and Journal of Marketing have accompanying datasets with their published studies that you can access. Note that you can access journal articles and their datasets for no cost if you access them via https://library.syr.edu/help/work-off- campus.php

Your project idea should address a business problem for an existing brand or product using marketing analytics. Your final project report should provide marketing strategy guidelines for the business problem you addressed using analysis of marketing data. Some sample project ideas are given below (note that not all of these sample issues have data available):
* What are customer perceptions of hybrid cars? How does a Toyota Prius compare to other hybrid cars in the market? You might use customer surveys and social media conversations to obtain a perceptual map.
* Through a conjoint experiment, evaluate how consumers trade off between prices and the various attributes and features of a vacation cruise line.
* Identify drivers of customer revenue and retention in an online grocery store such as Relay Foods. How can Relay Foods use this information to customize its product and marketing communications?
* What are the different customer segments for Harris Teeter? Do the segment sizes differ across stores? How can Harris Teeter use this information to design its product assortment?
The above are merely examples. You have a wide latitude in terms of what you can explore and discover.
