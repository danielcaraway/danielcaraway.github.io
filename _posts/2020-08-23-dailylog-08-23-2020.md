I didn't do much in the way of data science today.

I'm brainstorming how I can get my "daily commits" in here.

1. UPY, 25 min? New project? 
2. Write notes on what I've learned... Should that be a TIL or a daily log? 
3. Daily log should be progress updates for the DS projects I'm working on...

CURRENT:

UPY
TTA -- TikTokAPI
VG

PAST:
Covid
Kaggle
