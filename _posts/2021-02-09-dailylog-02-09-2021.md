Practiced some Tableau today!
Learned about Tableau [joins and relationships](https://help.tableau.com/v2020.4/pro/desktop/en-us/datasource_multitable_normalized.htm) and how relationships are the better default (but we can still do joins, if necessary)

NEXT STEPS:

1. Finish video
2. Import my own data as an experiment!
