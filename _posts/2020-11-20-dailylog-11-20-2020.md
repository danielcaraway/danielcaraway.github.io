## Why didn't this lookup work??
  
```python
# def get_selected(phone):
# #     print(phone)
#     print(type(phone))
#     try:
#         return phone_to_email[phone]
# #         return from_joy.loc[from_joy['Home Phone (Formatted)'] == phone]['Selected'][0]
#     except:
#         return 'No'
# #         print('nope')
# from_joy['Email'] = from_joy.apply(lambda x: get_selected(x['Home Phone (Formatted)']), axis=1)

```
