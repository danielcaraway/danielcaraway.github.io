IMPETUS: I'd like a job as a data scientist at Amazon.

PROBLEM: There are 3062 jobs listing "data scientist" somewhere in the title or description (at least this is the number of postings that comes back when I search "data science")

SOLUTION: Open every single one and compare the requirements and job description to my resume and desires

PROBLEM: Assuming this takes me one minute per posting (which is generous -- during trials it took me two minutes on average), this would take me 3062 minutes, or 51 hours or just over two days of uninterrupted job-post-reading.

SOLUTION: Use our friend Beautiful Soup to scrape the webpage!

PROBLEM: They are using React and Beautiful Soup is trying to scrape before the whole document has been rendered! Que lastima!

SOLUTION: Do a complicated set of awaits. JUST KIDDING. Go straight to the source and find the XHR request that is generating all this data in the first place.

PROBLEM: We now have a spreadsheet of 3062 job postings. How can we start to narrow this down?!

SOLUTION: Remove jobs outside of the US.

PROBLEM: We still have 2543 jobs to "look at."

SOLUTION: Investigate other ways of narrowing the search down before we start to apply NLP?

BRAINSTORM OTHER WAYS TO NARROW DOWN THE SEARCH: We could narrow down by city -- but a lot is going remote these days. We could narrow down by team -- but this isn't an easily accessible category (yes, it's there in an object under "team" but many still don't actually have a team listed). But really, we should be narrowing down by the qualifications. I shouldn't be spending any time looking at jobs requiring 5+ years of experience. I shouldn't be looking at jobs requiring Hadoop. I shouldn't be looking at jobs that say "data warehouse management."

But this is taking a long time to list out the things I shouldn't look at... right?
What if there was a way that I could "read" through the job requirements and assign point values to each req based on the list of skills I have?
What if there was a way that I could "read" through the job description and assign point values to each description based on what I'm looking for?

WELL DEAR FRIENDS. THANKFULLY, THERE IS.
