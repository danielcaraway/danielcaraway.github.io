## THINGS I LEARNED TODAY

1. If getting errors with `eval` Use `json.loads`


```python
import json

url = "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/one-pan-four-cheese-sun-dried-tomato-and-spinach-drunken-pasta-bake/"
r = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')
searched_word = 'wprmpuc_recipe_'
results = soup.body.find_all(string=re.compile('.*{0}.*'.format(searched_word)), recursive=True)
print('Found the word "{0}" {1} times'.format(searched_word, len(results)))
clean_result = results[0].split('=')[1].split(';')[0].strip()

info_dict = json.loads(clean_result)

```

## ANNA EXTENSION

IMPETUS: 
We want to be able to aggregate recipe data

PROBLEM: 
All recipe blogs are slightly different, format-wise

SOLUTION: 
Find something all recipe pages in all recipe blogs have in common -- THE WORD PRINT!!

PROBLEM:
How... how will we find this word in each page in such a way it can be used across multiple different blogs?

SOLUTION:
Beautiful soup and regex!!


```python
url = "https://minimalistbaker.com/orange-cranberry-crisp-gluten-free-easy/"
r = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')
searched_word = 'Print'
results = soup.body.find_all(string=re.compile('.*{0}.*'.format(searched_word)), recursive=True)
print('Found the word "{0}" {1} times'.format(searched_word, len(results)))
results[0].parent['href']

```
PROBLEM:
Ok great! We found the word PRINT,
