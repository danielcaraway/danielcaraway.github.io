## THINGS THAT DISTRACTED ME TODAY:

- Can I make an org chart in python? How would I do that?
- Can I make an interactive org chart in javascript?
- Can I use python to clean a messy excel sheet and export it into the data that the D3 chart might need?

## THINGS I LEARNED TODAY:

- Different ways to store images!!
  - Co-located disk (OK for small toy projects. NOT OK in production)
  - Databases (BAD because this is 4x as expensive as...)
  - Stream through a Data Store (Like Amazon S3)
  - Presigned URL (Best, with the most dev-ops overhead)
