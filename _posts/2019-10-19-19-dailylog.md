Things I did today:
1. Woke up!
2. Converted my new audio files into faster audio files
(make sure we are in correct directory with access to both ffmpeg and audiofiles)
[info](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/AAC)

```console
./ffmpeg -i Chapter5.m4a -filter:a "atempo=1.7" -c:a aac -q:a 100 chapter5_fast.m4a
```
  * This involved downloading ffmpeg and discovering a few suggested encoders weren't recommended anymore
  * This also involved me trying again to use `homebrew` with `sudo` which just shows how much more I need to learn about appropriate package management

3. Bought and "wrapped" amazon gift card for Bonnie!
4. Drove to Orange County (while listening to new fast files and FALL by Neil Stephenson) for friend's Sprinkle!
5. Ate enchilladas at Sprinkle!
6. Caught up with old friends :)
7. Drove home and chatted with Colin about how we get in our own way
8. Brainstormed ways we can help one another help ourselves
9. Started to work on HW3 (v1 -- using pandas and my own knowledge/intuition)
10. Started to work on HW3_GATES (using her code from the wall)
11. Scraped some HP reviews from IMDB!! [HARRY SCRAPER](https://danielcaraway.github.io/html/HW3_HP_IMDB_reviews.html)
