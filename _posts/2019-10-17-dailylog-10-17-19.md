annnnd everything is messed up on my path [again](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14117945/too-many-different-python-versions-on-my-system-and-causing-problems)

[This](https://www.ianmaddaus.com/post/manage-multiple-versions-python-mac/) eventually solved my problem

`touch .bash_profile` if no bash_profile yet

```console
$ open ~/.bash_profile
```

copy pasta
```
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH
```
