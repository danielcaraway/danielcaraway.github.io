[Run with Deception](https://danielcaraway.github.io/html/HW2_HW4_deception.html)

?!!?! 
I switched the 'true' and 'false'
So instead of reading the "true" in the file as "this review is true"
We're reading it as "is lie? True" 
MUCH.BETTER.RESULTS.

###  ISSUES!
Issues importing csv

Had to change delimiter to 

```python
dirtyFile = pd.read_csv('deception_data_converted_final.csv',  sep='\t')
```
[see here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18039057/python-pandas-error-tokenizing-data)

Which caused more problems, of course :)
