# Week 9: Machine Learning Part II

We're going to continue the challenge from last week of how we can use computer vision neural networks for classification and for some image recognition and image detection problems.

### 9.1 Continuing the Challenge

Our challenge this week-- again, using neural networks, using machine learning, using other advanced algorithms, how can we do object detection, facial recognition, image recognition, and classifiers? Real quick-- a distinction between object recognition or object detection and image recognition. Object detection is we want to identify at a high level an object. So think of a hierarchy that would say, a person, and then a specific person.

Object detection, image recognition, facial recognition are all classifiers

USING TENSOFLOW 

### 9.2 Base Architectures

### 9.3 Convolution Networks

That is correct. A memory cell preserves some state across time steps in a recurrent neural network.

### 9.4 Single-Layer Image Networks

### 9.5 Deep Neural Network

### 9.6 Architectures

### 9.7 Code Creation

Two quick programs today. One is ADELINE, the adaptive linear, and then the perceptron. And in both of these, we're going to be using the Iris data set.

### 9.8 Code Creation
