# Financial Analytics

MSDS (MBA) - Q5: FIN654

## Description:

This course is designed for analysts interested in pursuing a career in financial services with an emphasis on business analytics. Financial services traditionally includes banking, insurance, securities markets, and regulators. However, financial services are also found in organizational treasuries, departments of finance, CFO offices, investor relations, and any project where budgets, valuations, road maps, planning, and process efficiency require future projections of cash flows, growth rates, risk, and return.

An introduction to methods and tools useful in decision-making in the financial industry, which may from time to time include: macroeconomic event studies, analysis of term structures, equity data analysis, style analysis, credit risk, extreme value analytics, trading analytics, volatility measurement, portfolio management, and enterprise risk management.


## Learning Goals

Linear algebra, calculus, Boolean logic, numerical methods, optimization, and programming languages are not strictly pre-requisites. However, work in these areas enhances one’s numeracy, that is, capability to abstract complex, ill-posed business problems into tractable systematic models of behavior often mathemat- ically expressed.

Throughout the course we will use technically accurate notions of simultaneous equations, optimization of single and multiple variable functions, cumulants (summation and aggregation), probability statements (for quantiles, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing), linear model formulation and interpretation, random sampling, Monte Carlo simulation and bootstrapping. The course will introduce and review these areas as they emerge in financial analytic topics.
