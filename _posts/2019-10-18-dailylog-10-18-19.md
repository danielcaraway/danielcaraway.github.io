How I'm summarizing:
1. Get MANY_SENTENCES [paragraph/article/chapter/book?]
2. Split into sentences.
3. Create a frequency distribution (FD) for all (non stop) words in MANY_SENTENCES
4. Create a weighted fd (W_FD) for each word in FD by dividing each word by the most frequently occuring word (so most frequently occuring word is weighted closest to 1)
5. Go back to originally sentences, calculate their weighted sentence score (W_SS) by iterating over each word and getting the weighted score from our W_FD dict
6. Sort sentences by W_SS





CHAPTER 1
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much."The Potters, thats right, thats what I heard yes, their son, Harry" Mr. Dursley stopped dead."Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I dont know about that, but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didnt, so she went on.Theyre a kind of Muggle sweet Im rather fond of" "No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops.Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, "Yes -- yes, youre right, of course."Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke."I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore, nodding to her.'
