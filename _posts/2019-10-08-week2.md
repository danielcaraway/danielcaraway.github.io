## Readings

## 2.2 Tokenization
* To get computers to understand language, we need to turn things into numbers they can count

### What to count
* Tokens -- assemble a set of rules about grouping characters
* First, split into sentences (with punctuation)
* Second, split into words (with spaces)
* Which tokenizer is best? It depends on context & task
* N-Gram: Multiword Tokens
  * Uni-grams
  * Bi-grams
  * Tri-grams

#### Challenges with Tokenization
* When whitespace is absent (for example, in a URL, other languages etc.) tokenization is hard
* Lowercase vs. Uppercase -- which to choose?
* Same word means different things (bank and bank)
* Inflection (dishwasher, dishwashers)

#### Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
* use word context to decide the word sense
* so far doesn't help search engines significantly
* not widely used in text mining


## 2.3 VECTORIZATION 

### How to count

* Bag of Words
  * Boolean (sparce matrix)
  * Term frequency
  * Normalized term frequency
  * Tf*idf

* TF*IDF Vectors
  * Tf: term (word) frequency
  * Df: Document frequency how many docs contain this term) (e.g. in 2 out of 3 documents -- 2/3)
  * Idf: Inversed-document frequcny (3/2)
  * Tfidf = tf*log(idf)

* TL;DR -- TF*IDF penalizes common words and boosts the weight of rare words

### Normalization
* Normalization by Document Length (L-1)
* L2 Normalization ??

### Sparse Matrix
* Compressed Text Representation
(look up dictionary of "index:word" pairs)
Each word that occurs in a document will be recorded as an "index:value" pair

## 2.4 Reducing Vocabulary Size

### Stemming
[NLTK Stemming Demo](http://text-processing.com/demo/stem/)

### Lemmatizer

### Turn all to lowercase
* Note: Do not do this if the uppercase words are important 

### Remove Stopwords
#### ... with caution!
* The Secret Life of Pronounds What our words say about us
* (Identifying a personal blog/homepage by pronoun count)
* Function words for authorship attribution
* Gender Dfference in Speech and Writing
