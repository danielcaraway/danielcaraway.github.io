# Which zip codes should we invest in?

Well, there are A LOT of zip codes in the united states. Over 30K. 

Let's make this easy on ourselves and make N = 52 and break it down a bit --

# Which state should we invest in?

Well, we have graphs of past performance as well as future predictions [here](https://danielcaraway.github.io/assets/ist718lab6/IST718_LAB6_i6.html)

But these aren't super easy to look at and compare, right?

How can we break this down further for easy information ingestion? 

So we can... avoid... information indigestion. :D 

We could break it down by... timezone? Still that is ~ 12 per graph which is a lot.

We could break it down by number of zip codes within state? Number of counties within state? Average price within state?

We could also throw out anything that has a down trend...
