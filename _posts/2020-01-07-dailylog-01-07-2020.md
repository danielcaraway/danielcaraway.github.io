## THINGS I DID TODAY:
1. Woke up!
2. Filled out journal!
3. Continued IST718 Async work!
4. Tried to print out my lecture slides, ran into an issue because they were in PDF form and I wanted to print them out like slides so I could take notes and after trying a bunch of different things including uploading them to Google Slides (didn't work), Google Drive (simply uploaded them as a word doc, not what I wanted), opening the pdf in PowerPoint, eventually I just converted the pdfs to images so I could then import the images 
5. Attempted to listen to a case study using [Natural Reader](https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/) (one of the better readers I've found)
