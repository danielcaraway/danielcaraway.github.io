HAPPY PARTY FUN TIME YAY DISTRACTIONS!!

So, today we became obsessed with COVID19
(ALSO, WHO IS WE!?)

TL;DR: Discovered discrepancies in the WHO reports (via [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data)) and decided I needed to do something about it.

It started with kaggle:

Then looked at the situation reports from the WHO

### OUR PROJECT BEGINS

1. Check out the reports put out by the WHO and realize OMG they are just simple "this person clearly doesn't know how to use excel" problems because they are silly subtraction errors
2. Go to scrape the WHO page before realizing I should probably make sure I can actually get tabular data from a pdf or image. 
3. Do a few test runs 
4. Email Adrian at Pyimage search
5. Discover camelot 
6. Profit.
