# WEEK 2: Describing and Modeling

## 2.1 Scenario Introduction

OSEMN-- obtain, scrub, explore, model, and interpret. These five steps can guide us through both basic and advanced analytical techniques, from linear regression to neural networks in natural language processing. Today, we will focus on explore, model, and interpret.

Explore-- how do we describe the problem and the data we have available? Model-- what relationships exist between the variables and the response variable we're targeting? And interpret-- based on the model and our data and our analysis, what action do we recommend? What steps should we take to move from our current state to our desired state? In modeling techniques with predictive analytics, Professor Miller begins with a simple problem that will let us walk through several basic and advanced visualizations and begin to model some of the relationships between variables.
