## PDF to PPT Problems

```
convert -density 300 -trim test.pdf -quality 100 test.jpg
```

Then upload images to google slides. Print like ppt. 


## MOTIVATION: 
Tried to print out my lecture slides, ran into an issue because they were in PDF form and I wanted to print them out like slides so I could take notes and after trying a bunch of different things including uploading them to Google Slides (didn't work), Google Drive (simply uploaded them as a word doc, not what I wanted), opening the pdf in PowerPoint, eventually I just converted the pdfs to images so I could then import the images
