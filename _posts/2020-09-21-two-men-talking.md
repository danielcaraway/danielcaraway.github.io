## FRED:

Also, my rug was stolen.

## GEORGE:

Am I wrong!.

## FRED:

## FRED:

Am I wrong?.

## GEORGE:

Am I wrong?.

## FRED:

## FRED:

And Donny too.

## GEORGE:

And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.

## FRED:

And I assume this is credit card?.

## GEORGE:

And I know that you acted as courier.

## FRED:

And Im talkin about the Dude here
sometimes theres a man who, wal, hes the man for his timen place, he fits right in there
and thats the Dude, in Los Angeles.

## GEORGE:

And a good day to you, sir.

## FRED:

And a good friend.

## GEORGE:

And a lot about where he lived, like- wise.

## FRED:

And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.

## GEORGE:

And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didnt do anything.

## FRED:

And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.

## GEORGE:

And he was an avid bowler.

## FRED:

And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasnt time for a photo opportunity.

## GEORGE:

And let me point out
pacifism is not
look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq
pacifism is not something to hide behind.

## FRED:

And let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven.

## GEORGE:

And let me tell you something: I dig your work.

## FRED:

And lets also not forget
lets not forget, Dude
that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city
that isnt legal either.

## GEORGE:

And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.

## FRED:

And of course I still keep the rug.

## GEORGE:

And please dont call her my mother.

## FRED:

And report back to us as soon as its done.

## GEORGE:

And so, Theodore
Donald
Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of.

## FRED:

And this guy peed on it.

## GEORGE:

And this is the study.

## FRED:

And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes?

## GEORGE:

And was there anything of value in the car?.

## FRED:

And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?.

## GEORGE:

And we keep the baksheesh.

## FRED:

And we know that this is your homework, Larry.

## GEORGE:

And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.

## FRED:

And what do they got, Dude?

## GEORGE:

I did not know that.

## GEORGE:

I didnt blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway.

## FRED:

I didnt find it to be that exactly, but Ill allow as there are some nice folks there.

## GEORGE:

I didnt rent it shoes.

I dont like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.

I dont want to be responsible for any delayed after-effects.

## FRED:

I double back, grab one of em and beat it out of him!

## GEORGE:

I figure its easy money, its all pretty harmless.

## FRED:

I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.

## GEORGE:

I got a rash.

## FRED:

I got information
new shit has come to light and
shit, man!

## GEORGE:

I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand
.

## FRED:

I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax
.

## GEORGE:

I gotta tell ya Tony.

## FRED:

I guess hes pretty, uh, racially pretty cool
.

## GEORGE:

I guess thats the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin it-self, down through the generations, westward the wagons, across the sands a time until
aw, look at me, Im ramblin again.

## FRED:

I haff lingenberry pancakes.

## GEORGE:

I have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

## FRED:

I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesnt, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bums lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.
