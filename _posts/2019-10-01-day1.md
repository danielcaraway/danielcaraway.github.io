### 1.6 Difference between Text Mining and NLP

* NLP 
  * *Deep* linguistic analysis
  * (May take a long time to analyze large collections) 

* Text Mining 
  * Shallow analysis (e.g. N-grams) for quick analysis of large collections
  * (Sometimes use deep NLP features like PoS tags or dependencies for feature engineering)
