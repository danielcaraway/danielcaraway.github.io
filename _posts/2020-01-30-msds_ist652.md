## Description:

Scripting for the data science pipeline. Acquiring, accessing, and transforming data in the
forms of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data.

## Additional Course Description:

The goal of this class is to teach students the tools and skills of scripting needed to solve
problems of accessing and preparing data in a variety of formats and situations, sometimes
known as data wrangling. The scripting will provide the skills needed to form data science
pipelines, from acquiring and cleaning data to accessing data and transforming data for analysis
or visualization.

The main content focus is on information access and processing tasks on the types of
structured, semistructured, and unstructured data in current use in information applications. For
these three types of data, the course includes the use of structured numeric and text data such
as that from a spreadsheet or database, the use of data obtained through standard data
exchange formats such as HTML or XML from web pages or JSON from web-based APIs, and
the use of data obtained by pattern matching from text or log files. The scripting language
Python was chosen because of its ease of use and available packages to work with data in
many information applications. The skills learned in this class are intended to complement the
analytical and visualization skills learned in other data science courses. The scripting language
Python will be taught, but it will be assumed that students already have a programming
background, either through course work or through online study.

## Learning Objectives:

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

* write scripts to access and amass data from fields in structured data, access fields in
semistructured data, and define and find patterns of data in unstructured data;
* prepare and transform data to produce data summaries, lists, and networks;
* analyze and solve data access problems for the three types of data and to find and deploy
appropriate software packages that can be integrated into the problem solution; and
* frame real-world data questions and show how they can be answered from data.
