# Homework 2
# Copy mtcars dataset into new variable called myCars

# Question 1: find highest horsepower
max(myCars$hp)
# Question 2: find the car with highest horsepower
index <- which.max(myCars$hp)

# Step 2 - Explore mpg
# Question 3: What is the highest mpg?
max(myCars$mpg)
# Question 4: Which car has the highest mpg?

# Question 5: Create a sorted dataframe based on mpg

# Step 3 - Which car has the best combination of mpg and hp
# Question 6: What logic did you use?

# Question 7: Which car?

# Step 4 - Which car has the best car combination of mpg and hp, given equal weight?
#create normalized columns of mpg and hp
