watches happens theres big ame the crowd and thats the secretary defense charles kirkland joel fabiani whos sitting behind rick and who gets shot second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw knocked out this all happens the opening shot and creates many red herrings and possibilities what happened that opens this scene for close examination and total deconstruction what really happened this film asks and sets this film extremely well for when rick begins question people and get different perspectives the scene and discovers theres very good possibility was conspiracy follow rick trying learn more information also meet woman who was talking kirkland before was shot carla gugino and who flees the scene panic and tries hide from the cops the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors they can get witness takes what happened this all going pretty fine and dandy and its extremely interesting watch then takes one wrong step follow the wrong character and learn the answer the mystery too early and way before rick can find out but thats the worst part its that its the one person you didnt think would because was too obviously supposed the red herring the one you didnt think did because would stupid and cliched that person behind only gets worse the film turns into chase film about half way through the film and since already know what happened cant rely ricks investigation all that interesting its the film ran out the guts really complex and original about third the way and decided just fall back easy way out and that just happens mean that has become less and less credible events become more and more proposterous and the end the film has decided rely the worst offender mysteries like this the deux machina thats where some outside intereference brings the film sudden conclusion and makes everything okay this time its hurricane out-of-control police car and big round ball that adorned the arena what went wrong depalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people their respective fields and have been known for bringing life and complexity mysteries such this depalma who idolizes hitchcock death has done many film like this such his masterpiece blow out where movie soundman uses movie elements uncover conspiracy piece piece but granted depalma least makes intriguing watch what with his over-the-top shot set-ups otably the beginning and sequence where the camera pans over top bunch rooms the hotel forgetting anything about boundaries least his direction makes partly for then theres koepp who showed such great ability making characters flaws come life like did depalmas earlier carlitos way film that dove right into the life and past its character and examined him extremely well can write flawed character but his rick santoro seems just half-assed effort hes flawed and can see redemption the story wasnt formulaic scene towards the end where has make fatal decision cheapened the fact that his answer has emotional buildup may well have said the opposite what says would have least gone with what the character was like this the most disappointing kind film because promises intelligence and complexity because promises disection flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pulls the rug from under just were about convinced would able all the way was watching the first half hour couldnt wait see how the mystery would unearthed how many different perspectives hed given and perhaps hed have make choice between whos has believe theres film unfortunately the film has two major deux machinas one the disasterous ending the other about half hour when the film goes into autopilot and becomes stale and recycled piece crap weve seen all too much before but ever from someone like depalma\n",
